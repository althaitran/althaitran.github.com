					<h3>Quadris</h3>
					<info>
							Command-line-driven desktop game that is simply turn-based Tetris. I designed
							and programmed it in C++ alongside Guoyao "Freddie" Feng during our 2B term for our
							CS246 class (Object Oriented Programming). Much of my work was involved with the
							Application class (used to view the game), the Command classes (left, right,
							clockwise, etc.), the Block classes (L-block, T-block, O-block, etc.), and
							the Level classes (levels 0 to 3, of which much of the work dealt with how to
							distribute the probabilities of generating certain blocks at certain levels).
							<br>
							<br>
							This project demonstrates the use of several design patterns, such as the composite
							pattern (to describe how every object related to gameplay derives from a "Component"),
							and the strategy pattern (via the logic used for different levels). Such patterns were
							planned to make the different aspects of the game (eg., the graphic display and gameplay logic)
							easily changeable. This enables such opportunities as adding more logic for how the game behaves
							or what kind of blocks can exist without requiring a major revamp of the source code.
							This project showed that adhering to such patterns can result in more expandable code.
							<br>
							<br>
							Quadris requires the use of XWindow to play with a graphic display; otherwise, it can be
							played using a command-line display.

					<h3>Paper Airplane Game</h3>
					<info>
							Mouse/keyboard controlled Java applet game I made during my senior year
							of high school. Initially, it was a personal project I worked upon during
							my free time to sharpen my understanding of game development. However,
							when my AP Computer Science A teacher announced near the end of the school
							year that our final project for the course would be to create a Java project
							of our own choosing that implements Object-Oriented Programming principles, I
							felt that my Paper Airplane Game would be great at serving as my course project,
							as well.
