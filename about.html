            My interest in software design and development can probably be traced back to
            elementary school days, stemming from my interests in video games at the time.
            My interest in video games eventually led me to become more intrigued with
            how they were made, eventually piquing my interest in video game development.
            This, in turn, sparked my interest in the programming aspect of video game design,
            which encouraged me to take several computer science classes in high school,
            exposing me to such topics as algorithm design, object-oriented programming,
            and web development. Eventually, I came to realize that my future lied in the
            world of software development, and as such, I decided to attend the University
            of Waterloo for Software Engineering. I have since graduated in 2014.

            I mostly chose the University of Waterloo because of its renowned co-op program.
            I feel I learn best through hands-on experience, and Waterloo's co-op program allows
            me to get as much hands-on experience with software development and design in the
            working world as I want. It is also the reason why I've chosen Software Engineering
            as my career choice, as software design and development is a field that requires much
            practical experience to truly excel at it.
          </p>

            My favourite courses during my undergraduate career at the University of
            Waterloo have been "Algorithms and Data Structures," "Digital Computers," "Object
            Oriented Programming," "Foundations of Sequential Programs," "Operating Systems," 
            "User Interfaces," "Co-operative and Adaptive Algorithms," and "Computer Security
            and Privacy."
