        <div>
            Name: Alvin Tran<br>
            Occupation: 4A Software Engineering Student<br>
            School: University of Waterloo<br>
            <br>

          <p>
            I've been interested in software design and development since my elementary 
            school days (roughly starting from when I was 10 years old), and much of this
            interest stems from my interests in video games at the time. My interest in 
            video games eventually led me to become more intrigued with how they were made,
            eventually piquing my interest in video game development. This, in turn, sparked
            my interest in the programming aspect of video game design, which encouraged me
            to take several computer science classes in high school (including Advanced
            Placement Computer Science in senior year), further exposing me to such topics
            as algorithm design, object-oriented programming, and even webpage design.
            Eventually, I came to realize that my future lied in the world of software
            development, and as such, I decide to attend the University of Waterloo in
            Software Engineering, where I now stand as a 3A student. <br><br>
          <p>
          <p>
            I consider myself a very practical learner. As a result, I feel I learn best 
            when I get as much hands-on experience with whatever it is I am learning, rather 
            than simply reading or hearing about it. This has influenced my decision to 
            choose the University of Waterloo as my school of choice over several others, as 
            Waterloo's co-op program allows me to get as much hands-on experience with software
            development and design in the working world as I want. It is also the reason why I've
            chosen Software Engineering as my career choice, as software design and development
            is a field that requires much practical experience to truly excel at it.
            <br> <br>

            Thus far, my favourite courses during my undergraduate career at the University of
            Waterloo have been "Algorithms and Data Structures," "Digital Computers," "Object
            Oriented Programming," "Foundations of Sequential Programs," "Operating Systems," 
            and "User Interfaces." I am also currently taking a course in "Co-operative and
            Adaptive Algorithms," which I find to be the most intriguing of my current courses,
            at the moment. <br> <br>
